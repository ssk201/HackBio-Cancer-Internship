## Introduction

The paper comprehensively analyzed high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGS-OvCa) on a molecular level. This subtype is well-known for its aggressiveness and poor prognosis as it is responsible for 70% of deaths among patients with ovarian cancer. The aim was to find molecular abnormalities in HGS-OvCa samples that may affect patient outcomes, disease development, and serve as possible targets for treatment. For 489 HGS-OvCa tumors, the study assessed the expression of microRNA, mRNA, DNA promoter methylation, and DNA copy number using microarray analysis, resulting in whole exome DNA sequencing data for 316 tumors.

## Mutation Analysis

A mutation analysis was done on DNA from 316 tumor samples and identified approximately 1,80,000 exons from 18,500 genes using Illumina GAIIx and ABI SOLiD 3 platforms. The analysis covered 76% of coding areas and identified 19,356 somatic mutations, with an average of 61 per tumor. TP53 was mutated in 303 samples, and BRCA1 and BRCA2 had germline mutations in 9% and 8% of cases, respectively. Other mutated genes included CDK12, FAT3, CSMD3, RB1, GABRA6, NF1, KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA, and BRAF.

## Analysis of DNA Methylation Pattern**

Four distinct subtypes of HGS-OvCa were identified by analyzing the gene expression pattern and DNA methylation of 11,864 genes across three platforms: Affymetrix U133A, Agilent, and AffymetrixHuEx. The differentiated subtype displayed characteristics of a mature developmental stage, while the immunoreactive subtype was characterized by T-cell chemokine ligands. The mesenchymal subtype had increased stromal markers and high HOX genes. The proliferative subtype had increased proliferation markers and lower expression of ovarian tumor markers; in addition, 168 other genes showed decreased expression and increased DNA methylation. In 11.5% of tumors BRCA1 was silenced and hypermethylated, but RAB25, which is usually overexpressed in ovarian cancer, was silenced in some tumor samples.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, TP53 mutations are the most common mutations found in 96% of HGS-OvCa samples, with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations also playing a significant role in many cases. Promoter methylation has been found in genes linked to DNA repair, such as BRCA1, which leads to gene silencing and worsens patient outcomes. Tumor cells with a mutation in BRCA2, or both methylation and mutation in BRCA1 have defective DNA repair through homologous recombination. This defect forces the cells to rely on alternative repair mechanisms, making these cells more sensitive to PARP inhibitor treatment, which can kill them more effectively. These findings suggest promising therapeutic strategies, including the usage of PARP inhibitors and targeting homologous recombination deficiencies.
